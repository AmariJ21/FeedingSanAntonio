Feeding San Antonio ❤️
Why This Project Exists

I am proud of this cause.

FeedingSanAntonio was created with one simple but powerful mission:
to help feed people who are hungry and to give back to the community that raised us.

This project is not just about feeding the homeless.
It is about recognizing humanity, dignity, and responsibility. Hunger does not always look the way we expect it to, and it does not always live on the streets. It lives in our neighborhoods, our schools, and sometimes right next door.

This project is my way of taking action instead of looking away.

Martin Luther King Jr. once asked:
“What are you doing for others?”

That question is the foundation of this project.

What This Program Aims To Do

Connect people with food resources in San Antonio

Make it easier to find help when it is needed most

Encourage community involvement and compassion

Use technology as a tool for service, not just profit

This program exists because giving back matters.
Because communities are strongest when we take care of each other.

A Personal Note

This project comes from the heart.
It is built with care, respect, and the belief that everyone deserves to eat.

If this repository helps even one person find food, support, or hope—
then it has already done its job.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.
Thank you for caring.
